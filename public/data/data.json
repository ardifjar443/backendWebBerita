To date, no reports of Indonesian citizens becoming victims has been received.\n<\/p> <p>The Hamas armed group stormed the Israel-Gaza border fence from Gaza on October 7 and killed Israeli soldiers and civilians while taking dozens of people hostage from the region.<\/p> <p>Israel responded by launching massive strikes on Gaza and possibly followed by a ground attack into territory they abandoned almost two decades ago after 38 years of occupation.<\/p> <p>The Hamas attack killed 800 Israelis and injured 2,500 people. On the opposite side, Israel's air attacks left 500 Palestinians dead, with more than three thousand people injured.<\/p> <p>The United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) stated that almost 74 thousand refugees are housed in 64 UNRWA shelters. The figure is likely to increase as heavy attacks and airstrikes continue, including in civilian areas.<\/p> <img src='https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/ardifjar443\/backendWebBerita\/main\/public\/images\/1697099299foto1.png' \/><p>Reporter: Yashinta Difa P, Resinta Sulistiyandari\nEditor: Azis Kurmala\nCOPYRIGHT \u00a9 ANTARA 2023<\/p> <img src='https:\/\/beritabojonegoro.com\/imageoptim\/5b35d024-foto-semangat.lg.jpg' \/>","foto":"\/images\/1697099299.png","foto1":"\/images\/1697099299foto1.png","foto2":"\/images\/","foto3":"\/images\/","created_at":"2023-10-12 08:28:19","updated_at":"2023-10-12 08:28:19"},{"id":"1c7817ae-dc4b-4d82-86a9-0efb0eb0196c","title":"AIS Forum seeks smart solutions from scientists for marine issues","author":"ardi","deskripsi":"Nusa Dua, Bali (ANTARA) - The Archipelagic and Island States (AIS) Forum invited scientists to find smart and innovative solutions to resolve marine issues.","content":"<p>\"This conference is important as a place to learn, exchange ideas, and share innovations related to crucial issues in oceans and the future of island nations,\" Head of the AIS Forum Secretariat Riny Modaso stated during the First High-Level Meeting (HLM) of the AIS Forum in Nusa Dua here on Wednesday.<\/p> <p>Indonesia hosted the 1st HLM of the AIS Forum in Bali on October 10-11 to invite archipelagic and island countries to discuss four global issues together, namely, climate change, blue economy, handling plastic waste in oceans, and maritime governance.<\/p> <p>Some 22 researchers from the AIS countries presented current research and development and innovations related to marine biotechnology, sustainable aquaculture and fisheries, blue economy, and ocean and technology.<\/p> <p>\"This becomes a platform to showcase how science can contribute to marine ecosystem preservation in the future,\" he affirmed.<\/p> <p>Some innovations have been produced under the AIS Forum, such as the MonMang that can monitor mangrove ecosystem health, the Seagrass Carbon Converter (SCC), and the Advanced Drifter GPS Oceanography Coverage Area (ARHEA).<\/p> <p>To showcase togetherness, those innovations have been shared with other countries, such as the application of MonMang in Fiji, Germany, Japan, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).<\/p> <p>Meanwhile, rectors from the Bogor Agricultural University (IPB) and Padjadjaran University (Unpad) signed a partnership cooperation agreement related to maritime governance with Toliara University, Madagascar.<\/p> <p>The cooperation encompasses knowledge sharing and capacity building for technology and innovation implementation, including the development of rumpon, or a fish aggregating device, which is new in the country.<\/p> <p>The cooperation also covers strengthening the skills of fishing communities in Madagascar, especially in developing a more sustainable blue economy. <\/p> <img src='https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/ardifjar443\/backendWebBerita\/main\/public\/images\/1697100046foto1.jpg' \/><p>Reporter: Dewa W, Kenzu\nEditor: Rahmad Nasution\nCOPYRIGHT \u00a9 ANTARA 2023<\/p> <img src='https:\/\/beritabojonegoro.com\/imageoptim\/5b35d024-foto-semangat.lg.jpg' \/>","foto":"\/images\/1697100046.png","foto1":"\/images\/1697100046foto1.jpg","foto2":"\/images\/","foto3":"\/images\/","created_at":"2023-10-12 08:40:46","updated_at":"2023-10-12 08:40:46"}]
