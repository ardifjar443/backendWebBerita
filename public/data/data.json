To date, no reports of Indonesian citizens becoming victims has been received.\n<\/p> <p>The Hamas armed group stormed the Israel-Gaza border fence from Gaza on October 7 and killed Israeli soldiers and civilians while taking dozens of people hostage from the region.<\/p> <p>Israel responded by launching massive strikes on Gaza and possibly followed by a ground attack into territory they abandoned almost two decades ago after 38 years of occupation.<\/p> <p>The Hamas attack killed 800 Israelis and injured 2,500 people. On the opposite side, Israel's air attacks left 500 Palestinians dead, with more than three thousand people injured.<\/p> <p>The United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) stated that almost 74 thousand refugees are housed in 64 UNRWA shelters. The figure is likely to increase as heavy attacks and airstrikes continue, including in civilian areas.<\/p> <img src='https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/ardifjar443\/backendWebBerita\/main\/public1697099299foto1.png' \/><p>Reporter: Yashinta Difa P, Resinta Sulistiyandari\nEditor: Azis Kurmala\nCOPYRIGHT \u00a9 ANTARA 2023<\/p> <img src='https:\/\/beritabojonegoro.com\/imageoptim\/5b35d024-foto-semangat.lg.jpg' \/>","foto":"\/images\/1697099299.png","foto1":"\/images\/1697099299foto1.png","foto2":"\/images\/","foto3":"\/images\/","created_at":"2023-10-12 08:28:19","updated_at":"2023-10-12 08:28:19"}]
